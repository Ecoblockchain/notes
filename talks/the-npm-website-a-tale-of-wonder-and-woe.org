* Overview of npm
People started using Node and npm A LOT. This was unexpected. Dark
period in 2013 where npm went down a lot.

In 2014, npm decided to become a company. Raquel was the first
employee. The first iteration of the website existed in 2010 and was a
crummy little landing page. This was fine for 18 months, until in
2012, npm came packaged with Node.

So very quickly they needed to implement things like search! Raquel is
sad to say that this is still basicall the same search tool that is
used today.

When you have a small team (that is 1 or 2 ppl working on a site),
something interesting happens when you bring on new ppl. The codebase
becomes an "archeological dig site". You can see what was done, but
it's difficult to understand what influenced those decisions.
* Testing for Improving Confidence
npm started with unit tests, it wasn't enough. They have confidence in
nemo.js (by the PayPal team), which is as wrapper around Selenium.
* Modularity Is About Trust
Using a module means you trust the module's author.

Example: npm implemented a module for parsing markdown and every 36
hoursish the site would crash due to a massive memory leak. The module
authors never discovered this because they never had users who
operated at npm's scale.
* Open Source !== Community-Responsive
npm's team was small and didn't have bandwidth to move quickly enough
to respond to community demands.

They wer also using Travic CI, which would put them in the queue with
other public repos, so even if they were pushing a security fix, it'd
take up to an hour to publish the fix, which is unacceptable. So they
did an experiment. They made a private fork of their website. Only 2
people noticed.
