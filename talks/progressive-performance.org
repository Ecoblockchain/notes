To keep from wasting power, modern phones use big/little architecture,
which menas they move tasks from high power cores to low power cores
aggressively. The way these schedulers have been tuned, they will
schedule stuff to happen on high power cores on touch down, in
anticipation of animation, etc. But this doesn't actually match how
things work on mobile devices, because when we touch the screen, often
we send off a network request and then content comes in and *that's*
when we need the operation to be handled by the high power core.

"If you are using one of today's more popular JS frameworks in the
most naive way, you are failing by default. There is no
sugar coating this." - Alex Russell
