## What is quantum computing

Computing that uses superposition and entanglement to perform tasks. Offers
incredible performance improvements.

### Scaling is hard in quantum computers

* Sensitive to environmental noise
* Measuring quantum states destroys superposition, so creating RAM is hard
* No cloning: can't make copies that will necessarily collapse similarly

## 7 stages in development of fault-tolerant quantum information processing

1. single qubit operations
2. manipulate multiple qubits
3. error correction
4. memory of qubits after the fact
5. single-qubit quantum algorithms
6. multi-qubit quantum algorithms
7. fault-tolerant QC

## Designing programming languages for QC

Challenging but important:

* Must figure out semantics before hardware is available
* Difficult to design due to highly varied quantum computing implementations
